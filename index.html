                    Hello, I a glad you stopped by my page. I'm just staring to learn how to code, so please let me
                    know
                    if this is horrible!
                    The dog in the photo is Georgie, my Papillion Chihuahua. He is about to turn 11, and get two
                    younger
                    sisters!
                    I love hockey, Formula 1, gaming, and figuring out problems. So far, i am enjoying coding, as it
                    just seems like one big puzzle!
                    Right now, i happen to be writing just to fill some space. and i dont really want to write more
                    about myself! I am glad that we are not being
                    graded on our writing content, and rather our html and css content! I rarely do not want to talk
                    about myself, this
                    is truely a strange moment. I am so focused on wanting to write the code, that the only reason i
                    am
                    writing is to see if it
                    spills over beneth the image i've put in, as it did on the image in the example.
